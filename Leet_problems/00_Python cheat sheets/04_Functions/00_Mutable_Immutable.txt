To understand this gotcha, we must first establish what Python classifies as mutable.
A mutable object refers to various containers in Python that are intended to be changed.
A list for example has append and remove operations that change the elements of the list.
Sets and dictionaries are also two other mutable objects in Python as they can be changed on the fly.

Mutable:
-list
-Set
-Dictionary

Immutable:
-String
-Tuple
-Bool
-int
-float
-frozenset
